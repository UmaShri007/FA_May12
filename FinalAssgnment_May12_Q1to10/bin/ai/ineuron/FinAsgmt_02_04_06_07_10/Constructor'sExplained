********Key Points on Constructors***********
=============================================

.1:: Constructors are special methods that are used to instantiate an object at 
	 the time of creation itself.
.2:: Constructors should have the same name as the class
.3:: Constructors will have no return type.
.4:: Creation of an object involves a call to the constructor.
.5:: If the programmer hasn't written a constructor explicitly, the JVM during 
	 run time will add the default constructor,when there is acall to the constructor.
.6:: If the programmer has written a constructor explicitly,then the JVM wont add the
	 default constructor and its programmers responsibility to include default constructor.
.7:: Inside constructor first line will be this() or super() irrespective of written or not.
.8:: Constructors cant be inherited but can be invoked using super().
.9:: super() calls the parent class constructor
.10:: this() calls the same class constructor and that too the zero-arg constructor.
.11:: if the programmer hasn't specified any by default it will be super().
.12:: Calling one constructor from another is called Constructor Chaining.
.13:: There can be multiple constructors within the same class with different parameters,
	  its called Constructor Overloading.
